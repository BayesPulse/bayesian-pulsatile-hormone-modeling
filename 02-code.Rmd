## Code

Two primary sets of code are suggested for the repository: cleaning and
analysis scripts. Both should use file naming standards previously mentioned.

- *Require character variables to be either labeled (factors in R or varlabel in SAS) or standardized character strings*
- *Require variable labels in code-friendly format (CSV table: variable name, variable label; SAS 'label' statement; R dataframe; or REDCap script)*
- *Indicators/binary variables should be character and labeled (e.g. yes/no).*
