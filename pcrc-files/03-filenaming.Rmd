## Stanford University Libraries' "File Naming Best Practices"

via [Stanford Libraries](http://library.stanford.edu/research/data-management-services/data-best-practices/best-practices-file-naming)

The most important things to remember about file naming are to be consistent
and descriptive in naming and organizing your files so that itâ€™s obvious where
to find a file and what it contains. 

Information to consider including in file names:

- Project or experiment name or acronym 
- Location/spatial coordinates 
- Researcher name/initials 
- Date or date range of experiment 
- Type of data 
- Conditions 
- Version number of file 
- Three-letter file extension for application-specific files 

These are suggestions; include whatever information will allow you to
distinguish your files from each other and clearly indicate to you
what is in them. 

Other tips for file naming:

- A good format for dates is YYYYMMDD (or YYMMDD). This makes sure all your
  files stay in chronological order, even over many years. 
- Don't make file names too long; longer names do not work well with all types
  of software. 
- Special characters should be avoided: ~!@#\$%^&\*()\`;<>?,[]{}'" 
- For sequential numbering, use leading zeros to ensure files sort properly.
  For example, use "0001, 0002...1001r etc" instead of "1, 2...1001, etc." 
- Do not use spaces, because they are not recognized by some software. Instead
  use underscores (file\_name), dashes (file-name), no separation (filename),
  or camel case (FileName). 

Consider including a README.txt file in your directory that explains your 
naming convention along with any abbreviations or codes you have used.
